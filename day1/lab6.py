#WAP to print the first ten positive integers

#we are first declaring the range, which in this case is 1-10, as 
#the question has asked us to print the first 10 positive integers

for i in range(1,11):   #(x,y), where x is the starting point 1 and y is the ending point 11
    print(i)            #the program always prints upto an element less than the ending point
                        #which here is 10.
