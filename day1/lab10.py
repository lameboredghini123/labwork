#WAP to calculate & print the sum of the first ten positive integers as a list

#we are first declaring a list containing the first ten positive integers and storing them in a variable 'list1'
list1=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

#we are using the sum() function which will directly output the sum of all the elements in the list
print(sum(list1))
